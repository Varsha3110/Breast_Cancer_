# Breast_Cancer_Diagnosis
The key challenge against its detection is how to classify tumors into malignant (cancerous) or benign(non-cancerous), by using classification models.

# Description:
Breast cancer is the most common cancer amongst women in the world. It accounts for 25% of all cancer cases, and affected over 2.1 Million people in 2015 alone. It starts when cells in the breast begin to grow out of control. These cells usually form tumors that can be seen via X-ray or felt as lumps in the breast area. The aim is to Build classification models to predict whether the cancer type is Malignant or Benign. 

# About the dataset:
The dataset has been referred from kaggle. The dataset contains 569 samples of malignant and benign tumor cells.

# Steps to be done:
1- Importing Libraries
2- Data Engineering
3- Data Visualiozation
4- Label Encoding
5- Feature Scaling using Standard Scaler
6- Model Implemenation
7- Confusion Matrix
8- Accuracy Paradox
9- Cross Validation
